# Items App!

## Product Requirements

As a user of _Items App!_ I should be able to:

- Add items (max 10)
- Select items (only one selected at a time)
- Remove a selected item
- Delete items
- Add a custom item (unimplemented)

so that I can manage my items

## Setup

### Clone

```bash
git clone <repo>
```

### Install

```bash
npm i
```

### Run

Either in separate terminal windows

```bash
npm start
npm run cypress:open

```

Or in a single stream (potentially noisy):

```bash
npm run start:all
```
